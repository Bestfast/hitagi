# Hitagibot

Hitagibot is a plugin based Telegram bot written in python 3 and licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License V3. Currently functionality is very barebones (ie. inline support is non-existant).

###Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TopBakuhatsu/nanobotpython.git
```
In config.py add your bots API key and add your ID to admins.
```python
API = "131440568:Gosaahfeyvla4Jvkt5Cirybksingh1pu42I" #Add your key here (This one won't work)
admins = [
123456789, #Add admin(s) here
]
```

After that you can run the bot!
```bash
cd hitagibot
python3 main.py
```
