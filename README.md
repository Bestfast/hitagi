# Hitagibot

Hitagibot is a plugin based Telegram bot written in python 3 and licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License V3. Currently functionality is very barebones. The bot focuses on providing a lightweight modular environment for bot creation.

###Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TopBakuhatsu/nanobotpython.git
```
In config.py add your bots API key and add your ID to admins.
```python
API = "131440568:Gosaahfeyvla4Jvkt5Cirybksingh1pu42I" #Add your key here (This one won't work)
admins = [
123456789, #Add admin(s) here
]
```

After that you can run the bot!
```bash
cd hitagibot
python3 main.py
```
###Plugins
Plugins are simple to make. Every plugin will need: 

**`plugin_info`**

Here is where you should place plugin information. This includes a pretty name, short description, and list of commands.

**`regex`**

regex should be a list containing all "triggers" for your plugin. Use [regex101](https://regex101.com/) to create and test them.

**`main`** 

main will always be the function where you recieve the [msg](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#message) object and return your bots reply. Returning just a string replies to the command using markup formatting. Returning a dictionary with the parameters located [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendmessage) allows for finer control.
